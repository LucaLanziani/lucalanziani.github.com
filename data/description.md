I began developing software at the age of 14 using Pascal and I fell in love with Linux at the age of 18. 

I got my **master degree in Computer Engineering in 2010**, from these studies I learned how to approach problems academically but I never forget to use a pinch of creativity.

I always have really hard time leaving problems unsolved and I prefer to hear different opinions before making a decision.

Open source addicted, I'm glad to share knowledge and I will never get tired of learning new things. I love the way how the startups approach problems and I'm always looking for a job about edge technologies.

Last experiences: sync and backup multi-platform client (Python / wx), Web technologies (HTML5, javascript, css), plugin systems and communication bus on Linux Embedded (C / libdl / pubsub).
