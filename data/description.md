### Hi I'm Luca, an Italian software engineer now working in London

![me](img/minime.jpg "You know me")

I started writing software at the age of 14 using Pascal and I **fell in love with Linux** at the age of 18.

I got my **master degree in Computer Engineering in 2010**, from these studies I learned how to approach problems academically **but I never forget to use a pinch of creativity.**

I always have really hard time leaving problems unsolved and **I love solve difficult puzzles.**

Open source addict, I'm glad to share knowledge and I will never get tired of learning new things.

**Last experience:** Betting platform as Software Engineer and DevOps (Python / Javascript), sync and backup multi-platform client (Python / wx), Web technologies (HTML5, javascript, css), plugin systems and communication bus on Linux Embedded (C / libdl / pubsub),
