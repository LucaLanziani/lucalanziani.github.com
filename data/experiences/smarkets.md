Smarkets is a betting exchange for trading sports, politics and entertainment events. I'm currently working on the backend side using Python. This experience is giving me the possibility to work in a complete production environment, using various technologies such as Vagrant, Jenkins, Rabbitmq and Sentry and practices as Scrum and CI.
