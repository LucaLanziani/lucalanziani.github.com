Smarkets is a betting exchange for trading sports, politics and entertainment events. I'm currently working on the backend side using Python. This experience is giving me the possibility to work in a complete production environment, using various technologies such as _Vagrant_, _Jenkins_, _RabbitMQ_ and _Sentry_ and practices as _Scrum_ and _CI_.
