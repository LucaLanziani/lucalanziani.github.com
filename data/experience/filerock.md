FileRock is a secure, backup and synchronization service. I mainly worked on the **Open Source** [client] [1], a multi-platform software that encrypt and sync data in the cloud completely written in **Python**.

In the last months I worked on a new web interface completely written in HTML5 and **Javascript** as a single page application (SPA), using **Angularjs** framework. I used **PhoneGap** framework to bring this implementation on mobile devices.
