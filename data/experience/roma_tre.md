I designed and developed a software in C language, on a linux embedded platform (FOX Board G20) for the SAETTA project, that takes care of dynamically-load software modules and manage the communication between them.

The software aims to centralize the communication and standardize the concept of module and data, providing a set of APIs that make it easier to develop.

SAETTA is the main project in the robotic lab of the Roma Tre University, it aims to develop a robotic swarm able to execute tasks of scientific interest.
